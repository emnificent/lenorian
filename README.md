# Lenorian calendar
The Lenorian calendar is more than just a way to track time â€” it's a celebration of human rights!

## Future updates

- [ ] Use SvelteKit's store to avoid reloading API data when navigating back to the home page
- [ ] Store weekdays and months names as well as holidays in a single file
- [ ] Hide Discord's webhook in a `.env` (I'll refresh it, please don't abuse it in the meantime)
- [ ] Switch to an API whitelist and allow people to request API access
- [ ] Switch to tokens as API authorization for devs to make requests
